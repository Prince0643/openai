## SYSTEM OVERVIEW: OMNI CHAT AUTOMATION FLOW

### 1. **User Initiates Chat** (via Instagram)

- Bot greets the user with a welcome message
- Determines intent by asking:
    - Are they looking to book a class?
    - Are they inquiring about memberships?
    - Do they want to speak with someone?
    - Other common FAQs (e.g. location, schedule, prices)

### 2. **If Class Booking**

- Bot asks what type of class they’re interested in
    
    (e.g. strength, conditioning, yoga, etc.)
    
- Presents available times pulled from **GymMaster**
    - Uses GymMaster API
    - Checks class availability and capacity
- Sends a direct booking link or asks for details to complete booking
- Once booked, bot sends:
    - Confirmation message
    - Link to GymMaster app if needed
    - Reminder 30 minutes before class (via Manychat)

### 3. **If Membership Inquiry**

- Bot explains available memberships
    - Info sourced from the membership PDF or API
- Shares prices, package details, what’s included
- Can direct user to purchase link or request follow-up by staff

### 4. **If FAQ / General Inquiry**

- Bot checks against trained responses from the FAQ list
- If unable to answer:
    - Logs the question in a shared Google Sheet
    - Optionally escalates to human (Manychat operator)

### 5. **If PT Session Request**

- Bot collects user goals, preferred time, and trainer (if needed)
- Sends to Omni team for manual assignment and follow-up

### 6. **Post-Class Follow-up**

- After a class (time-based or via webhook), bot sends:
    - Feedback request: "How was your class?"
    - If positive: prompts for Google/IG review
    - If negative: flags to team and offers human follow-up

### 7. **Lead Capture + Logging**

- All user info (name, phone, interest, etc.) is logged in:
    - Google Sheet (lead tracker) - ask: **We saw GymMaster also has a sales funnel to track lead management and outreach. Is it easier/possible to link everything on GymMaster (follow-up dates, status, etc) and keep the google sheet purely unanswered questions?**
    - GymMaster
- Sheet also tracks:
    - Unanswered questions
    - Follow-up dates
    - Status (cold/warm/converted)

### 8. **Broadcasts / Announcements**

- You’ll be able to send IG broadcasts via Manychat
    - Only to opted-in users per Meta rules
    - Example: class changes, promos, events
