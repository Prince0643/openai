# Solution for Make.com 500 Internal Server Error

Based on our testing, your backend system is working correctly, but you're experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when connecting from Make.com. Here's how to resolve this issue:

## Quick Diagnosis

✅ Your server is running correctly (tested locally)
✅ Your webhook endpoint is working (returned 200 OK with test)
❌ The connection between Make.com and your localtunnel URL is failing

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. Expired Localtunnel URL
**Symptoms**: The URL you're using in Make.com no longer works
**Solution**:
1. Restart localtunnel:
   ```bash
   npx localtunnel --port 3000
   ```
2. Update the new URL in your Make.com scenario
3. Test the new URL directly in your browser

### 2. Firewall or Network Restrictions
**Symptoms**: Make.com cannot reach your localtunnel URL
**Solution**:
1. Try accessing your localtunnel URL in a browser
2. Check if your network blocks outgoing connections
3. Try using a different network if possible

### 3. Incorrect URL in Make.com
**Symptoms**: 404 errors or connection timeouts
**Solution**:
1. Verify the URL in your Make.com HTTP module exactly matches your localtunnel URL
2. Make sure it includes `/make/webhook` at the end
3. Example: `https://your-subdomain.loca.lt/make/webhook`

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Restart Your Local Tunnel

1. In the terminal running localtunnel, press `Ctrl+C` to stop it
2. Start it again:
   ```bash
   npx localtunnel --port 3000
   ```
3. Note the new URL that appears

### Step 2: Update Make.com Configuration

1. Go to your Make.com scenario
2. Open the HTTP module
3. Update the URL with the new localtunnel URL
4. Save the changes

### Step 3: Test the Connection

1. Run a test execution in Make.com
2. Watch your server terminal for log messages
3. Look for lines like:
   ```
   Received webhook from Make.com: { ... }
   ```

## Testing Your Connection

### Test 1: Direct Browser Access
1. Open your localtunnel URL in a browser
2. You should see a message like "Cannot GET /"

### Test 2: Direct API Test
1. In PowerShell, run:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://YOUR_NEW_URL/make/webhook" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"message": "Test", "userId": "test123"}' -UseBasicParsing
   ```

### Test 3: Make.com Test
1. Run a test execution in Make.com
2. Check the execution log for detailed error information

## Common Fixes

### Fix 1: Restart Everything
1. Stop your server (`Ctrl+C`)
2. Stop localtunnel (`Ctrl+C`)
3. Start your server: `node openaitomanychat.js`
4. Start localtunnel: `npx localtunnel --port 3000`
5. Update Make.com with the new URL

### Fix 2: Check Make.com Module Configuration
Ensure your Make.com HTTP module has:
- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `https://your-subdomain.loca.lt/make/webhook`
- **Headers**: Content-Type = application/json
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "{{1.message}}",
    "userId": "{{1.userId}}",
    "threadId": "{{1.threadId}}"
  }
  ```

### Fix 3: Check Payload Format
Make sure ManyChat is sending the correct payload to Make.com:
```json
{
  "message": "User's message here",
  "userId": "unique_user_identifier",
  "threadId": "optional_thread_id"
}
```

## Monitoring for Success

When the connection works, you'll see in your server logs:
```
Received webhook from Make.com: { ... }
```

And Make.com will show a successful 200 response with a JSON body like:
```json
{
  "response": "Assistant's answer here",
  "threadId": "thread_abc123",
  "userId": "user123",
  "success": true
}
```
