# GymMaster API Validation

## Validation Results

We've successfully validated that the GymMaster API integration is working correctly:

### Direct API Call
- URL: `https://omni.gymmasteronline.com/portal/api/v1/booking/classes/schedule?api_key=309b28e47ec3126feab3f4319c8ed8e5`
- Response: 36 classes retrieved successfully
- Status: ✅ Working

### GymMaster API Client
All test cases passed:
1. **No parameters**: ✅ Working - Retrieved 36 classes
2. **With date parameter**: ✅ Working - Retrieved 36 classes
3. **With date and companyId**: ✅ Working - Retrieved 36 classes

## API Response Structure

The GymMaster API returns a rich data structure with the following key fields for each class:
- `id`: Class identifier
- `arrival`: Class date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `starttime`/`endtime`: Class times
- `bookingname`/`name`: Class name
- `staffname`: Instructor name
- `companyname`: Branch name
- `spacesfree`: Available seats
- And many more detailed fields

## Client Mapping

Our GymMaster API client correctly maps the raw API response to a simplified structure:
- `classId`: Maps to `id`
- `name`: Maps to `bookingname` or `name`
- `coach`: Maps to `staffname`
- `branch`: Maps to `companyname`
- `start`: Combines `arrival_iso` and `starttime`
- `end`: Combines `arrival_iso` and `endtime`
- `seatsAvailable`: Maps to `spacesfree`

## Conclusion

The GymMaster API integration is working correctly. The issue with the Make.com integration is not with the GymMaster API itself, but with the OpenAI assistant tool call handling, which we've already fixed in the previous updates.

The fixes we've implemented should resolve the 500 errors you were experiencing.
