# Actual Fix Summary

## The Real Issue

The core problem was in the `/make/webhook` endpoint in [openaitomanychat.js](file:///c%3A/Users/CH/Downloads/openaitomanychat/openaitomanychat.js). When the OpenAI assistant needed to call tools (like `get_schedule_public` for class schedules), it would return a "requires_action" status, but the webhook endpoint wasn't properly handling this status.

## What Was Wrong

The original implementation only waited for the run to complete without checking for or handling tool calls:

```javascript
// Original problematic code
while (runStatus.status !== "completed" && runStatus.status !== "failed" && (Date.now() - startTime) < maxWaitTime) {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  runStatus = await openai.beta.threads.runs.retrieve(thread.id, run.id);
}
```

This meant that when the assistant needed to call tools, it would wait indefinitely (or until timeout) because the required tool outputs were never submitted.

## The Fix

I've implemented proper tool call handling in the webhook endpoint:

1. **Check for "requires_action" status**: The code now checks if the run status is "requires_action"
2. **Extract tool calls**: When tool calls are required, it extracts the tool call information
3. **Execute tools locally**: It calls the appropriate GymMaster API functions directly
4. **Submit tool outputs**: It submits the tool results back to the assistant
5. **Continue polling**: It continues polling until the assistant completes

## Key Changes

1. **Extended timeout**: Increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds to allow time for tool calls
2. **Proper tool call handling**: Added logic to handle the "requires_action" status
3. **Direct API calls**: Instead of relying on the separate `/tool-call` endpoint, the webhook now calls GymMaster APIs directly
4. **Better error handling**: Enhanced error handling for tool calls

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **No more hanging requests**: The assistant no longer waits indefinitely for tool calls
2. **Direct API integration**: Tool calls are executed directly within the webhook, eliminating network issues
3. **Faster response times**: No need to make additional HTTP requests to the `/tool-call` endpoint
4. **Better reliability**: Fewer moving parts mean fewer potential failure points

## Next Steps

1. The changes have been pushed to your GitHub repository
2. Trigger a redeploy on Render to apply the fixes
3. Test the Make.com integration again
