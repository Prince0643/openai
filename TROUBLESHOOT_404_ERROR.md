# Troubleshooting 404 Error in Your Chatbot Backend

This guide will help you understand and resolve the 404 error you're seeing when accessing your backend service.

## Understanding the 404 Error

The 404 error ("Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404") means that a requested resource was not found on the server. In the context of your chatbot backend, this is likely happening because:

1. You're trying to access the root URL [/](file://c:\Users\CH\Downloads\openaitomanychat\HOW_TO_CONNECT_TO_MAKE.md) in a browser
2. Your application doesn't have a root route defined (which is normal for API backends)
3. You're trying to access a non-existent endpoint

## Why This Happens

Your application is designed as a backend API service, not a website. It has specific endpoints for specific purposes:

### Available API Endpoints
1. `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
2. `POST /member/login` - Member login
3. `POST /find_or_create_member` - Find or create member
4. `GET /schedule/public` - Public class schedule
5. `GET /class/seats/:classId` - Class seat availability
6. `POST /book/class` - Book a class
7. `POST /cancel/booking` - Cancel a booking
8. `GET /member/:memberId/memberships` - Member memberships
9. `GET /member/:memberId/profile` - Member profile
10. `POST /save/lead` - Save lead information
11. `GET /catalog` - List catalog
12. `POST /process-message` - Process message with OpenAI
13. `POST /tool-call` - Handle tool calls
14. `POST /make/webhook` - Handle Make.com webhooks

## How to Test Your Application Correctly

### 1. Test the Health Endpoint
```bash
# Using curl
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Using PowerShell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/health -UseBasicParsing
```

### 2. Test the Webhook Endpoint
```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/make/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Test", "userId": "user123"}'

# Using PowerShell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/make/webhook" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"message": "Test", "userId": "user123"}'
```

### 3. Test the Public Schedule Endpoint
```bash
# Using curl
curl "http://localhost:3000/schedule/public?date_from=2025-10-16"

# Using PowerShell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/schedule/public?date_from=2025-10-16" -UseBasicParsing
```

## Common Causes and Solutions

### Cause 1: Accessing Root URL in Browser
**Symptoms**: Opening `http://localhost:3000` in a browser shows 404
**Solution**: This is expected behavior. Use the specific API endpoints instead:
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- Webhook: `http://localhost:3000/make/webhook` (POST only)

### Cause 2: Incorrect Endpoint in Make.com
**Symptoms**: Make.com shows 404 errors in execution logs
**Solution**: 
1. Verify your Make.com HTTP module URL ends with `/make/webhook`
2. Ensure you're using the POST method
3. Check that your localtunnel or Render URL is correct

### Cause 3: Frontend Application Trying to Load Non-existent Resources
**Symptoms**: Browser console shows 404 errors for CSS, JS, or other assets
**Solution**: Your backend doesn't serve static files. If you need to serve a frontend:
1. Add static file serving to your application
2. Deploy frontend separately
3. Use a CDN for static assets

## Adding a Root Route (Optional)

If you want to add a simple root route for testing purposes, you can add this to your [openaitomanychat.js](file:///c%3A/Users/CH/Downloads/openaitomanychat/openaitomanychat.js):

```javascript
// Add this after the other routes, around line 90
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    message: "Omni Gym Chatbot Backend API", 
    status: "OK",
    endpoints: [
      "GET /health",
      "POST /make/webhook",
      "GET /schedule/public",
      // ... other endpoints
    ]
  });
});
```

## Testing with Different Tools

### 1. Using cURL
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/make/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello", "userId": "user123"}'
```

### 2. Using PowerShell
```powershell
# Test health endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/health" -UseBasicParsing

# Test webhook endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/make/webhook" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"message": "Hello", "userId": "user123"}'
```

### 3. Using Postman or Insomnia
1. Set method to GET or POST as required
2. Set URL to your endpoint
3. Add headers if needed (Content-Type: application/json)
4. Add body for POST requests

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Server Logs
Look at your terminal where the server is running for any error messages or request logs.

### 2. Verify Server is Running
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

### 3. Test with Different Endpoints
Try accessing different endpoints to see which ones work:
- `http://localhost:3000/health` (should work)
- `http://localhost:3000/make/webhook` with POST (should work)
- `http://localhost:3000/nonexistent` (should return 404)

## Prevention Tips

1. **Always use the correct endpoints** - Don't try to access the root URL unless you've defined a route for it
2. **Use appropriate HTTP methods** - Some endpoints require POST, not GET
3. **Check your URLs carefully** - Typos in URLs will cause 404 errors
4. **Test endpoints individually** - Verify each endpoint works before integrating with other services

## When to Seek Help

If you're still getting 404 errors after:
1. Verifying you're using the correct endpoints
2. Confirming the server is running
3. Checking that you're using the right HTTP methods
4. Verifying your URLs are correct

Then check:
1. Your firewall settings
2. Port conflicts
3. Network connectivity issues

## Useful Commands for Diagnosis

### Check if server is listening
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

### Test health endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Test webhook endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/make/webhook -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"message\": \"Test\", \"userId\": \"user123\"}"
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the 404 error you're experiencing.
