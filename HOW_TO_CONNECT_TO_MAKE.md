# How to Connect This System to Make.com

## Direct Answer to Your Question

To connect this system to Make.com so that:
- The system fetches data from Make.com 
- Then passes answers back to Make.com

You need to:

### 1. Use the Existing Webhook Endpoint

Your system already has a dedicated endpoint for Make.com integration:
- **Endpoint**: `POST /make/webhook`
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/make/webhook` (or your public URL when exposed)

### 2. Expose Your Local Server

Since your server runs locally, you need to expose it to the internet:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start your server
node openaitomanychat.js

# Terminal 2: Expose it to the internet
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

This will give you a public URL like: `https://stupid-parts-join.loca.lt`

### 3. Configure Make.com Scenario

In Make.com:

1. **Create a new scenario**
2. **Add Webhooks > Custom webhook** as your trigger
3. **Add HTTP > Make a request** module with:
   - **Method**: POST
   - **URL**: `https://YOUR_LOCALTUNNEL_URL/make/webhook`
   - **Body**:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "{{1.message}}",
     "userId": "{{1.userId}}",
     "threadId": "{{1.threadId}}"
   }
   ```

### 4. Handle the Response

Add another module to receive the response and send it back through your workflow.

## How It Works

```
[ManyChat] 
    ↓ (Sends user message)
[Make.com Webhook Trigger]
    ↓ (Forwards to your system)
[Your Backend → /make/webhook]
    ↓ (Processes with OpenAI + GymMaster)
[Make.com HTTP Response Module]
    ↓ (Sends processed response)
[ManyChat]
    ↓ (Displays to user)
```

## Data Flow

1. **Make.com fetches data** by sending a POST request to your `/make/webhook` endpoint
2. **Your system processes** the message using OpenAI Assistant and GymMaster APIs
3. **Your system passes the answer back** to Make.com in the HTTP response
4. **Make.com sends the response** back to ManyChat

## Example Request/Response

**Make.com sends to your system:**
```json
{
  "message": "What classes are available today?",
  "userId": "user123",
  "threadId": null
}
```

**Your system responds to Make.com:**
```json
{
  "response": "Here are today's classes at Omni Gym...",
  "threadId": "thread_abc123",
  "userId": "user123",
  "success": true
}
```
