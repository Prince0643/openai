# Troubleshooting 500 Internal Server Error on Render Deployment

This guide will help you resolve the 500 Internal Server Error you're experiencing with your Render deployment.

## Current Status Analysis

Based on your logs and health check:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T15:08:10.418Z",
  "config": {
    "gymmaster": true,
    "backendKey": true,
    "openai": true
  },
  "env": {
    "GYMMASTER_API_KEY": "SET",
    "GYMMASTER_BASE_URL": "SET",
    "BACKEND_API_KEY": "SET",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "SET"
  }
}
```

Your application is now working correctly! The "404 Not Found" error when accessing the root URL (`https://openai-o3ba.onrender.com/`) is expected because your application doesn't have a root route defined.

## Identified Issue: Character Encoding Problem

Looking at the exact request Make.com is sending:
```json
{
  "message": "show today's classes at Omni Kuta.",
  "userId": "371492018",
  "threadId": ""
}
```

The issue is likely caused by the smart quote character (`'`) in "today's". This character might be causing JSON parsing issues or other problems in your application.

## Solution: Add Character Encoding Handling

Let's modify your application to handle character encoding issues properly. Add this middleware to your [openaitomanychat.js](file:///c%3A/Users/CH/Downloads/openaitomanychat/openaitomanychat.js) file:

1. Find the section where you have:
```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```

2. Replace it with:
```javascript
// Add proper JSON parsing with character encoding handling
app.use(express.json({ 
  limit: '10mb',
  type: 'application/json'
}));

// Add URL encoding middleware
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

## Alternative Solution: Test with Escaped Characters

Try sending the request with the apostrophe properly escaped:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://openai-o3ba.onrender.com/make/webhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"message\": \"show today\'s classes at Omni Kuta.\", \"userId\": \"371492018\", \"threadId\": \"\"}"
```

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Check Render logs** when Make.com makes requests to see specific error messages
2. **Test with the curl command above** to see if character encoding is the issue
3. **Modify your application** to handle character encoding properly as shown above

## If Character Encoding Isn't the Issue

If the character encoding solution doesn't work, the issue might be:

1. **OpenAI API Issues**:
   - Check if your OpenAI API key is valid and has the necessary permissions
   - Verify that your assistant ID `asst_xy382A6ksEJ9JwYfSyVDfSBp` is correct

2. **Timeout Issues**:
   - OpenAI processing might be taking too long
   - Make.com might have a shorter timeout than your 30-second limit

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - You might be hitting OpenAI rate limits

## How to Debug Further

1. **Check Render logs** for specific error messages when the webhook is called
2. **Add more detailed logging** to your webhook endpoint:
   ```javascript
   app.post("/make/webhook", async (req, res) => {
     console.log("Webhook called with body:", JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
     // ... rest of your code
   });
   ```

3. **Test your OpenAI assistant directly** using the test script to make sure it's working:
   ```bash
   node test_assistant.js
   ```

The most likely cause is the character encoding issue with the smart quote in "today's". Try the solutions above and check your logs for specific error messages.
