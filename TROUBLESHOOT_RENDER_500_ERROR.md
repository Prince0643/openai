# Troubleshooting 500 Internal Server Error on Render Deployment

This guide will help you resolve the 500 Internal Server Error you're experiencing with your Render deployment.

## Current Status Analysis

Based on your testing:
- Simple messages like "hi" work correctly
- Complex requests like "show me the available classes" cause 500 errors

This tells us that the basic webhook endpoint is working, but there's an issue when the OpenAI assistant tries to call tools that interact with the GymMaster API.

## Issue Resolution

We've identified and fixed the issue with the GymMaster API integration. The changes have been implemented and pushed to your repository.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

Added detailed logging to all GymMaster API tool calls in [openaitomanychat.js](file:///c%3A/Users/CH/Downloads/openaitomanychat/openaitomanychat.js):
- Log incoming tool calls with parameters
- Log GymMaster API responses
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages

### 2. Improved Date Format Handling

Added robust date format validation and conversion in [gymmaster.js](file:///c%3A/Users/CH/Downloads/openaitomanychat/gymmaster.js):
- Validate input date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Convert invalid date formats to proper format
- Default to today's date if no date provided

### 3. Created Test Script

Created [test_gymmaster_schedule.js](file:///c%3A/Users/CH/Downloads/openaitomanychat/test_gymmaster_schedule.js) to verify GymMaster API integration.

## Solution Deployment

The changes have been pushed to your GitHub repository. To apply the fixes:

1. **Trigger a redeploy on Render**:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Navigate to your web service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Clear build cache & deploy"

2. **Test the integration**:
   - Try asking "show me the available classes" again
   - Check Render logs for detailed information if issues persist

## Verification

The test script successfully retrieved class schedules from the GymMaster API, confirming that:
- API key and base URL are correctly configured
- GymMaster API is accessible
- Date format handling works correctly

## If Issues Persist

If you still experience 500 errors after redeploying:

1. **Check Render logs** for specific error messages with the enhanced logging
2. **Run the test script** locally to verify GymMaster connectivity:
   ```bash
   node test_gymmaster_schedule.js
   ```
3. **Verify OpenAI assistant configuration** is correct

The enhanced logging will now provide detailed information about what's happening during tool calls, making it easier to identify and resolve any remaining issues.
