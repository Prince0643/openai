# Deployed Endpoint Testing Results

## Test Results

1. **Health Check**: ✅ Working correctly
   - Status: 200 OK
   - All environment variables are properly set
   - GymMaster, OpenAI, and backend key configurations are correct

2. **Simple Message Webhook**: ✅ Working correctly
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Response: Assistant provides a general greeting
   - Thread ID is generated correctly

3. **Class Request Webhook**: ❌ Hanging/Timeout
   - Request takes >30 seconds
   - Eventually times out
   - No response returned

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is with the OpenAI assistant's tool calling mechanism:

1. When a user asks for "today's classes", the OpenAI assistant recognizes this as a request that requires calling the `get_schedule_public` tool
2. The assistant returns control to your application with a "requires_action" status
3. Your application is supposed to:
   - Call the GymMaster API to get the schedule
   - Submit the results back to the assistant via the `/tool-call` endpoint
   - Continue polling until the assistant completes

## The Problem

The tool call mechanism isn't working correctly in the deployed environment. This could be due to:

1. **Network Issues**: The assistant might not be able to reach your `/tool-call` endpoint
2. **Authentication**: The `/tool-call` endpoint requires a backend API key that might not be configured correctly
3. **Timeout Issues**: The 30-second timeout for OpenAI assistant runs might be too short for the tool calls

## Solution

We've already implemented enhanced error handling and logging in your code. The next steps are:

1. **Check Render Logs**: Look for specific error messages when the tool-call endpoint is accessed
2. **Verify Backend API Key**: Ensure the BACKEND_API_KEY is correctly configured in your Make.com scenario
3. **Redeploy**: Push the latest changes to Render to ensure all fixes are applied

## Immediate Action Items

1. Check Render logs for tool-call endpoint errors
2. Verify that the BACKEND_API_KEY in your Make.com scenario matches the one in your Render environment variables
3. Test the /tool-call endpoint directly to ensure it's accessible
