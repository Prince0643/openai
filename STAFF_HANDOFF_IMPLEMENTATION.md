# Staff Handoff Implementation

This document explains how smart staff handoff functionality has been implemented for the OpenAI to ManyChat integration system.

## Overview

The system now provides intelligent staff handoff for lost & found, complaints, or unclear requests, ensuring users receive proper assistance while staff members get notified with complete context.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Staff Handoff Manager Module

A new module `staffHandoffManager.js` was created to handle all staff handoff functionality:

- Ticket creation with full context (user ID, message, contact info, category)
- Ticket management (assign, resolve, retrieve)
- Persistent storage using JSON file
- Staff notification system

### 2. Key Features

- **Context-Rich Tickets**: Each ticket includes user ID, message, contact info, and conversation thread
- **Categorization**: Tickets are categorized (lost & found, complaints, unclear requests)
- **Assignment Tracking**: Staff can claim and manage tickets
- **Resolution Workflow**: Tickets can be marked as resolved
- **Persistent Storage**: All tickets stored in `staff_tickets.json`
- **Staff Notifications**: Automatic console notifications when tickets are created

### 3. Integration Points

The handoff functionality is integrated into two key areas:

1. **Tool Call Endpoint** (`/tool-call`) - Direct tool calls from assistant
2. **Make.com Webhook** (`/make/webhook`) - Assistant-initiated handoffs during conversations

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

When a handoff occurs, users receive a helpful response:
> "Sorry about the bottle. Please tell me the date/time and branch; I'll alert the front desk now."

Staff members receive complete context:
```
=== STAFF NOTIFICATION ===
New ticket created: TICKET-0001
Category: lost_and_found
User: user_001
Message: I lost my water bottle at the gym yesterday around 6 PM
Contact: {"email":"user1@example.com","phone":"+1234567890"}
========================
```

## API Functions

### Creating Tickets
```javascript
const ticket = createTicket({
  userId: "user123",
  message: "I lost my water bottle",
  contactInfo: { email: "user@example.com", phone: "+1234567890" },
  category: "lost_and_found",
  threadId: "thread_123"
});
```

### Managing Tickets
```javascript
// Get ticket by ID
const ticket = getTicket("TICKET-0001");

// Assign ticket to staff
assignTicket("TICKET-0001", "staff_member_001");

// Resolve ticket
resolveTicket("TICKET-0001");

// Get open tickets
const openTickets = getOpenTickets();

// Get statistics
const stats = getTicketStats();
```

## Testing Verification

The implementation passes all requirements:

- ✅ **Helpful User Response**: Users receive clear, helpful responses
- ✅ **Staff Notification**: Staff receive tickets with transcript and contact details
- ✅ **Context Preservation**: Full conversation context is maintained
- ✅ **Categorization**: Requests are properly categorized
- ✅ **Persistence**: Ticket data survives server restarts

## Files Created

- `staffHandoffManager.js`: Core handoff functionality
- `test_staff_handoff.js`: Comprehensive test suite
- `STAFF_HANDOFF_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: This documentation
- `staff_tickets.json`: Persistent ticket storage (auto-generated)

The system is now ready to handle smart staff handoffs while ensuring all user requests are properly tracked and staff members receive complete context for assistance.
